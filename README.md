<b>Youtube Clone Using React Js :</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>I developed a YouTube clone using ReactJS that replicates core YouTube features such as video playback, a functional menu, and a video list. The app is fully functional and leverages React Router for seamless navigation between pages, providing a smooth single-page application experience.
<br>
<br>
I utilized React hooks like useState and useEffect for managing component states and handling side effects, such as fetching data.
<br>
<br>
The YouTube Data API v3 enables fetching video lists, details, and comments, while dynamic routing allows users to play videos and access relevant details by clicking on thumbnails, just like the real YouTube platform.
